# PyTorch Learning Repository

Welcome to my PyTorch learning repository! This project is a collection of code, notes, and insights from my journey to learn PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. The majority of the code and concepts are based on tutorials and resources from the following sources:

## Tutorials and Resources

### Patrick Loeber's PyTorch Tutorial
This repository includes code and examples from Patrick Loeber's comprehensive tutorial series on PyTorch. You can find the playlist here: [Patrick Loeber's PyTorch Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqnslRFeH2UrcDBWF5mfPGpqQDSta6VK4).

### Neural Networks by 3Blue1Brown
In addition to Patrick Loeber's tutorials, I have also included insights and pointers from the 3Blue1Brown series on neural networks. This series provides an excellent visual and intuitive understanding of neural networks. You can watch the series here: [Neural Networks by 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi).

### deeplizard on Youtube 
Her tutorials on CNNs, and their visualization are a great place to start after you have the basics of a neural network down.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Sample datasets used for training and testing models.
- `Notes/`: A PDF file with my personal notes and observations.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zaina826/Pytorch-Tutorial.git
cd Pytorch-Tutorial
```


Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can explore the Python scripts in the main directory for various PyTorch models and utilities. Check out the `Notes/` directory for my personal notes and additional insights in the PDF file.

Happy learning!
